# Editor

The browser editor is a project-root-aware authoring shell for World, Entity, Definitions, Models, and MOD modes. It edits repository-native TOML/assets through the File System Access API; it is not part of the simulation runtime.

## Shell and persistence

`ModeShell` owns the active mode, per-mode open files, dirty state, and undo history. `project-root.js` persists a granted directory handle in IndexedDB and exposes path-based reads/writes. `SaveFlow` centralises validation, serialisation, writes, dirty-state clearing, and invalidation events.

`InvalidationBus` tells dependent modes when an entity, world, faction, or other shared definition changes. `entity-cache.js` keeps parsed entity TOML keyed by repository path and invalidates affected entries after saves.

## Modes

- World mode (`scenario-mode.js`) edits scenario/world TOML, entity placement, layers, content, and Rhai script.
- Entity mode edits template sections against the shared component schema.
- Definitions mode edits faction and complexity data through typed save payloads.
- Models mode edits model-rig/LOD authoring surfaces.
- MOD mode packages mod content against the existing validation boundary.

MOD ZIP import is the `editor.mod.import` semantic action in the `editor.mod`
context. It uses the shared local feedback lifecycle. A readable pack is loaded
into the existing workspace before validation, so definite findings are focused
and announced without discarding its source members. The workspace retains an
immutable copy of the imported archive and each ordered entry's exact bytes;
when the manifest fields and a member's text remain untouched, repair/export
reuses those bytes so comments, ordering, extension keys, and line endings do
not vanish. ZIP paths and contents use fatal UTF-8 decoding, matching the Rust
upload reader. An unreadable ZIP or manifest leaves the previous workspace
intact. T2 does not add the M6 live inspectors or project tooling to this editor.

The same bounded workspace now exposes a source textarea for one selected
member, preserving its imported base classification/digest and immutable source
entry while the edited text changes. `editor.mod.validate` runs the existing
export gate without downloading or clearing MOD dirty state;
`editor.mod.export` runs that gate and downloads only an accepted ZIP. Both use
Pressed/Pending/Applied-or-Refused feedback, focus an accessible refusal, and
return successful focus to Export. Import, Validate, and Export each have two
slots in the shared private operator profile and can be remapped through the
common controls component. The parent client catalogue retains those bindings
across surfaces, while ordinary play Settings filters out editor-only actions.
Reset All is profile-wide: Captain, Helm, and editor remaps return to their
authored defaults together. Feedback presentation is keyed per semantic action,
so a busy Export or Import refusal remains alongside an outstanding Validate
Pending state instead of erasing it. This tracer adds no unified inspector,
project-root editing, model tooling, or Workshop redesign.

## Standalone Workshop Authoring

`workshop.html` is M6's offline browser Authoring surface. `trunk build` ships
the page and its runtime WASM artifact; `npm run build:workshop` updates the
HTML/JS and dependency snapshot alongside an existing runtime. On Windows,
`run-workshop.bat` runs Trunk and uses
`scripts/serve-workshop.mjs` to serve it on loopback port 8083, opening the browser
only after the server is listening. Its JavaScript and runtime are local build artifacts. It opens
one new or user-selected mod ZIP without a project-directory grant or GM session.
`WorkshopDocument` owns immutable imported bytes, the editable source documents,
and one chronological `UndoStack` across the whole pack. The source editor
preserves unknown keys, comments, source BOMs and unchanged mixed line endings;
it does not run the old editor's normalizing serializers. Undo selects the
document it changed. Dirty state compares against the imported or last exported
source, independently of history and validation.

The thin `workshop-authoring.js` adapter uses shared private Accessibility,
semantic Import/Validate/Export bindings, remapping and attributed local action
feedback. Accepted action bindings take precedence over conventional history
shortcuts outside editable fields. A failed replacement import or export keeps
the prior draft and history. Export validates the exact candidate archive through
`src/workshop`: the ordinary mod-pack gate, runtime source parsers, include and
composition checks, and budgeted Rhai compiler. Static child worlds and scripts
resolve against an explicit immutable base/other-pack source snapshot. Validation
does not install content, start an App, or apply a content ledger. Missing runtime
artifacts or dependencies refuse export. Findings link back to authored files and
reported lines. `WorkshopDocument.check()` remains a structural helper for older
consumers; the Workshop UI never treats it as runtime acceptance.

The field inspector uses `toml_edit` source spans in the same Rust module. It
patches exactly one scalar and refuses stale documents or incompatible types;
comments, unknown fields, ordering and unchanged line endings remain byte-for-byte.
World `[global]` descriptors derive expected types and defaults from the actual
`GlobalConfig` fields. Other scalar paths, including arrays and inline tables,
remain available as source fallback fields and pass the same final runtime gate.
Every displayed field is Authoring-only; none provides an arbitrary live write.

`workshop-recovery.js` stores one versioned data-only draft in its own IndexedDB
database. The record carries immutable imported bytes, current documents, last
exported documents, selected path and chronological history. Reload requires an
explicit Restore or Discard before another import. Corrupt records and storage
failure never silently replace the open source. This storage grants no filesystem
authority and carries no private operator profile or live runtime state.

Source and binary file additions/replacements use the same chronological history.
Binary members, including GLB and MP3, never pass through a text decoder. Undo of
an addition removes that member; undo back to the original source set restores
the complete original ZIP container. Pack validation still refuses binary members
until the runtime asset overlay is implemented. A loaded pack can enter through
`createBrowserWorkshopProvider` as an immutable source archive with separately
snapshotted dependencies; the selected pack is removed from the other-pack list.
The dependency viewer is read-only and never adds those files to the editable pack.

`NativeWorkshopProvider` is an offline selected-project or selected-mod-directory
capability constructed by native code. Its JSON request vocabulary cannot select
another root. It reads authored paths under `assets/` (plus a mod's `scenarios.toml`),
refuses traversal, path aliases and symlinks, and compares the complete loaded disk
source plus its revision before saving. Project saves use the real project manifest,
runtime source parsers, include/composition checks and the ordinary budgeted script
compiler. Mod saves use the same pack validator as browser export.

Native writes journal exact before/after bytes before replacing or deleting any
member. Reopening finishes an interrupted accepted save, but refuses an external
edit instead of overwriting it. A separate private per-root directory holds the
OS workspace claim, save journal and crash-draft record. Recovery retains the old
revision, so restoring a draft cannot silently overwrite newer files on disk.
`mountNativeWorkshop` mounts the same shared Authoring UI over a private request
callback and reply receiver; no browser HTTP/file provider is introduced. The
native shell/CLI wiring is the next integration step.

Disposable Test simulation, specialised entity/definition/model panels and runtime
model asset overlays remain later M6 work. The existing editor/viewer remain
until the parity workflow is delivered.

## Validation boundary

The editor performs fast client-side structural checks in `validation.js`, `world-toml.js`, and `entity-toml.js`. Runtime/PASM remain authoritative: saved scenario changes still need `uv run pasm validate`, `scan`, and `traceability`, while entity/config changes still pass Rust parsing and the repository's normal gates.

World composition uses `extra_worlds` and Rhai `load_world`/`unload_world` actions. Both flow into the same runtime `WorldLayerChange` path documented in [World Data](./world-data.md) and [WorldPlugin](../concepts/world-plugin.md).
