//! The winit/Bevy adapter for bridge-display profiles (issue #1123).
//!
//! [`super::bridge_profile`] is the pure model; this is the layer that reads real
//! monitors off Bevy's [`Monitor`](bevy::window::Monitor) components and opens
//! one borderless-fullscreen surface per configured monitor. It is testable only
//! under the `#[ignore]`d integration test on a machine with real displays
//! (`tests/native_bridge_displays.rs`), exactly as issue #1121's and #1122's GPU
//! proofs are — CI is GPU-less and headless, so nothing here runs there.
//!
//! # What it does, once monitors are known
//!
//! * The **viewscreen** role goes on the process's **primary window** (the one
//!   `native_render_stack` already opened and the game cameras already target),
//!   put into [`WindowMode::BorderlessFullscreen`] on the viewscreen monitor. So
//!   the #1121 viewscreen render lands on the right display with no camera
//!   retargeting at all.
//! * Each **Station** role spawns an *additional* borderless-fullscreen
//!   [`Window`] on its monitor, tagged with [`BridgeSurface`], and its one or two
//!   pane rectangles are published in [`BridgeStationSurfaces`] for the pane host
//!   to compose onto (see the note there).
//! * A monitor the profile assigns but that is **not present** is logged, not
//!   re-homed; a present monitor with **no assignment** is logged too. The pure
//!   [`resolve`](super::bridge_profile::resolve) makes that judgement; this layer
//!   only reports it.
//!
//! # Why an exclusive system, and why it retries
//!
//! `bevy_winit` fills the [`Monitor`](bevy::window::Monitor) entities a frame or
//! two into the run, not at `Startup`. So [`apply_bridge_profile`] is an
//! exclusive system that runs every frame and does its work once: it returns
//! quietly while no monitors are known yet, then applies the profile and inserts
//! [`BridgeDisplayApplied`] so it never runs again. It is exclusive because it
//! reads the monitor entities, mutates the primary window, spawns new windows and
//! inserts resources in one pass — the same shape `panes::ultralight::init_pane_host`
//! uses for the same reason.
