# Editor

The browser editor is a project-root-aware authoring shell for World, Entity, Definitions, Models, and MOD modes. It edits repository-native TOML/assets through the File System Access API; it is not part of the simulation runtime.

## Shell and persistence

`ModeShell` owns the active mode, per-mode open files, dirty state, and undo history. `project-root.js` persists a granted directory handle in IndexedDB and exposes path-based reads/writes. `SaveFlow` centralises validation, serialisation, writes, dirty-state clearing, and invalidation events.

`InvalidationBus` tells dependent modes when an entity, world, faction, or other shared definition changes. `entity-cache.js` keeps parsed entity TOML keyed by repository path and invalidates affected entries after saves.

## Modes

- World mode (`scenario-mode.js`) edits scenario/world TOML, entity placement, layers, content, and Rhai script.
- Entity mode edits template sections against the shared component schema.
- Definitions mode edits faction and complexity data through typed save payloads.
- Models mode edits model-rig/LOD authoring surfaces.
- MOD mode packages and inspects mod content against the project layout.

MOD ZIP import is the `editor.mod.import` semantic action in the `editor.mod`
context. It uses the shared local feedback lifecycle. A readable pack is loaded
into the existing workspace before validation, so definite findings are focused
and announced without discarding its source members. The workspace retains an
immutable copy of the imported archive and each ordered entry's exact bytes;
when the manifest fields and a member's text remain untouched, repair/export
reuses those bytes so comments, ordering, extension keys, and line endings do
not vanish. ZIP paths and contents use fatal UTF-8 decoding, matching the Rust
upload reader. An unreadable ZIP or manifest leaves the previous workspace
intact. T2 does not add the M6 live inspectors or project tooling to this editor.

## Validation boundary

The editor performs fast client-side structural checks in `validation.js`, `world-toml.js`, and `entity-toml.js`. Runtime/PASM remain authoritative: saved scenario changes still need `uv run pasm validate`, `scan`, and `traceability`, while entity/config changes still pass Rust parsing and the repository's normal gates.

World composition uses `extra_worlds` and Rhai `load_world`/`unload_world` actions. Both flow into the same runtime `WorldLayerChange` path documented in [World Data](./world-data.md) and [WorldPlugin](../concepts/world-plugin.md).
