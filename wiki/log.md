## [2026-05-08] seed | Bootstrap wiki from existing project state

Initial wiki creation. Inspired by Karpathy's LLM-Wiki gist
(https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

Sources ingested in this pass:

- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md` (repo root)
- All Rust modules under `src/` (server, client, shared)
- All draft design docs under `docs/` (1–8 + Architecture Improvement Notes)
- All issues labeled `PRD` on GitHub: #1, #17, #22, #36, #51, #66

Pages created:

- `SCHEMA.md`, `index.md`, `log.md`
- `entities/`: player, session, console, captain-console, helm-console, ship,
  asteroid, world-data, bridge-crew-stations-planned
- `concepts/`: project-overview, architecture, networking, message-flow,
  codec-seam, game-phases, game-loop, ship-physics, asteroid-field,
  radar-projection, view-modes, view-model-pattern, console-plugin-pattern,
  build-and-deployment, testing-strategy
- `sources/`: prd-001, prd-017, prd-022, prd-036, prd-051, prd-066,
  design-01..design-08, notes-architecture-improvements,
  repo-readme, repo-agents, repo-context
- `roadmap/`: overview, console-expansion, combat-and-damage,
  data-driven-content, open-architectural-questions

Open questions captured:

- Drafts 6, 7, 8 are stubs in the source — wiki entries flag this.
- "Architecture Improvement Notes" describes per-console message subscription
  but no PRD has been written yet — captured under
  `roadmap/open-architectural-questions.md`.

## [2026-05-08] ingest | Roadmap pages written | touched: roadmap/overview, roadmap/console-expansion, roadmap/combat-and-damage, roadmap/data-driven-content, roadmap/open-architectural-questions

Synthesised the five `roadmap/` pages from existing source pages (PRDs #1, #17,
#22, #36, #51, #66 and design drafts 1–8 + Architecture Improvement Notes).
No new sources ingested; this is a synthesis pass.

Cross-cutting tensions surfaced:

- PRD #66's single hull pool vs Draft 4's four-quadrant shields (rewrite path).
- Captain-only `SetView` vs Draft 3's Science-driven viewscreen content.
- One-shot `WorldData` vs Draft 2's streamed nearby asteroids.
- Hardcoded tunables vs Draft 5's power-modulated multipliers.

Six open architectural questions catalogued; each blocks at least one drafted
feature.
